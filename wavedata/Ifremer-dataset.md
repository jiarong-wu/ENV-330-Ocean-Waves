A 20-year wave hindcast based on WAVEWATCH-III with 3 hourly outputs. Simulations are forced by ERA5 winds (0.5 degree resolution), CMEMS-GLOBCURRENT currents, SSMI ice mask and ALTIBERG iceberg mask on a global grid nested with regional subgrids at higher resolution.

Files are written as NetCDF outputs with all the fields lumped together. The wave spectrum is partitioned into wind waves and maximum 5 swell components. The visualization.ipynb notebook gives an example of visualizing some fields in the data set.
